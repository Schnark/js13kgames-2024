This repository hosts my submission for https://js13kgames.com/.

The game is a Rogue-like, Lord Balsekil stole your seven lucky charms, and you have to get them back.

There are several versions of the game:
* Official version: https://js13kgames.com/games/lord-balsekils-lairs-of-bad-luck
* Development version: https://schnark.github.io/js13kgames-2024/
* Minified version: https://schnark.github.io/js13kgames-2024/min/

Things I would have added given more space and time:
* wall shading
* save/restore
* Lord Balsekil and his henchmen could utter funny maledictions while fighting
* in-game help
* levels with rooms and mazes together
* different images for differently sized monsters
* optional ASCII display
* music
