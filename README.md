This repository hosts my submission for https://js13kgames.com/.

The game will be a Rogue-like, among the monsters there will be black cats, and you can throw a horseshoe for a ranged attack (they do return like boomerangs, I'm sure), but the details may still change a lot, as will display, code and everything else.

There are several versions of the game:
* Official version: NOT YET
* Development version: https://schnark.github.io/js13kgames-2024/
* Minified version: https://schnark.github.io/js13kgames-2024/min/
